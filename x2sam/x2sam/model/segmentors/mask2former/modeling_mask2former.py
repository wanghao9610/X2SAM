        config ([`Mask2FormerConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Args:
        pixel_values (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, height, width)`):

            [`AutoImageProcessor.preprocess`] for details.
        pixel_mask (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, height, width)`, *optional*):

        output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
